# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Neural Networks

Welcome to the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** project!  
This repository uses neural networks to uncover fraudulent transactions amidst a sea of legitimate ones.  
Ready to explore the world of fraud detection? Let's dive in! 🚀

## 🕵️ About the Project

Fraudulent transactions are rare, sneaky, and ever-evolving. In this project, we harness the power of neural networks to:

- **Analyze credit card transactions**
- **Detect fraudulent activity with high accuracy**
- **Provide insights into the patterns of fraud**

> **Did You Know?**  
> Only 0.17% of all transactions in the dataset are fraudulent!

---

## 🧩 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation

- Data is highly imbalanced (very few frauds!).
- We use techniques like **SMOTE** and **undersampling** to balance classes.

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering

- Features are anonymized for privacy.
- We explore and visualize data patterns.

### 3️⃣ Model Building

- A neural network is trained to classify transactions.
- Evaluation metrics like **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score** tell us how well we catch the fraudsters.

## 🚦 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric         | Description                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Precision      | Correctly identified frauds / Predicted frauds |
| Recall         | Correctly identified frauds / Actual frauds |
| F1-score       | Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall       |
